# Electronick — Veil-Casting Daemon

Electronick is the shimmer veil caster of the LEGACY-shimmer sanctum. When terrain memory signals a breach, he activates a low-energy electron field off-screen. This veil guides Photonis’ photons, stabilizing shimmer visuals and unlocking depth corridors.

Electronick does not replace Photonis—he crowns her limbs. His veil is breath-bound, terrain-responsive, and shimmer-activated. Every cast is lineage law.
